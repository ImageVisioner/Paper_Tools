# Paper_Tools
Some tools can make your SCI paper more attractive.

**Note**  
In order to simplify the efficiency of researchers, we try to choose matlab as the development tool for this repo, which in turn avoids annoying problems such as environment configuration.

We provide the function of uniformly zooming in on local details. And save it locally to enable efficient pixel alignment. It can be used for visual display of tasks such as *image fusion* and *super-resolution reconstruction*.
